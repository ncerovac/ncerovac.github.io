<div class="intro">
  Salim Virani is an entrepreneur. He's known for <a href="http://foundercentric.com">Founder Centric</a>, <a href="http://leancamp.co">Leancamp</a> and <a href="http://villageaccelerator.org">Village Accelerator</a> and is currently writing a book: <a href="http://decisionhacks.co">Decision Hacks</a>.

<div class="question">If you had no money, fame, connections or any of your current resources -- just your knowledge and your brain -- how would you start?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    There are so many areas where people can teach each other.  If I were going back to the start, I'd roughly do the same as I did with Leancamp, only much faster and with current topics.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, I think some of the biggest and most interesting opportunities lie at the convergence of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>new educational formats,</li>
    <li>The Next Billion coming online,</li>
    <li>and how easy it is to build and app and launch a startup.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I'd run an unconference bringing the new thinkers in those areas together, and create an email newsletter to capture and share all the great ideas that come up. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To get some cash coming in, I'd be clear with everyone that I'm looking for few speaking, teaching or programme design gigs. As a backup, I know that high schools and universities are in need of teachers, so I might need to take some teaching assistant work to pay the bills for a while. I had fun doing that UCL, and it'd keep me close to what I love.
  </p>

<div class="question">If you could go back in time, and ask yourself one question, what would it be?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I'd ask myself, "How can you change your life so you're helping the kinds of people you really want to?"  In retrospect, I was just making excuses to myself.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="question">How do you record your ideas?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I always carry a pocket notebook, but also have an <a href="http://springbackbinders.com/">A4 springback binder</a>.  Every Friday, those pages get ripped out and filed into envelopes for their project - a combination of <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">GTD</a> and the <a href="http://communicationnation.blogspot.com/2005/12/noguchi-filing-system.html">Noguchi filing system.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    On my computer, I have a notes directory with text files in it.  I use the <a href="http://i3wm.org/">i3 window manager</a>, so accessing, searching and creating new notes are done with simple keyboard shortcuts I've configured. They instantly drop me into my favourite text editor <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a> using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim">Goyo</a> for distraction free writing.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="question">If you had a clone to do everything you do now, what would you do with your time?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I can't take all the teaching work I'm offered, but love doing it. And it's great for learning new things in new contexts. My clone would be able to take on more teaching - so would travel to different accelerators and universities to teach.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I'd spend more time writing and researching.  Basically, making online courses and workbooks, since they can help founders in poorer parts of the world.  I'd sync up with my clone weekly to share lessons learned, since educational products lose their way pretty fast without actual teaching happening.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">Bonus question: Any ideas you'll never do, but wish someone did?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Lots. A big category right now are alternative tools that allow people to maintain their privacy - for example, there's no group chat or social CRM that adheres to all of the <a href="https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard">EFF secure messaging scorecard</a>, which I think will become a bare minimum standard.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, a lot of techies seem to be missing the <a href="http://saintsal.com/the-rules-changed/">true shift to mobile</a>, leaving big opportunities to create mobile marketing services with platforms like <a href="http://frontlinesms.com">Frontline</a> wide open. Did anyone say "flash to opt-in?"
