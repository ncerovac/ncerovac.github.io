shortDesc: Rackspace, founder of BuyerDeck
---
<div class="intro">Gerald Vanderpuye is an entrepreneur. He's known for being head of international development sales at <a href="http://rackspace.com">Rackspace</a>, and founder of <a href="http://buyerdeck.com">BuyerDeck</a> and is currently growing BuyerDeck like crazy!</div>

<div class="question">
    If you had no money, fame, connections or any of your current resources — just your knowledge and your brain — how would you start?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I would start by working for free in the area of the idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had nearly no money and definitely no fame when I founded my startup BuyerDeck so the only real thing I would miss is the connections. 
  </p>
  <p>
    With just knowledge and my brain, I would start by making new connections today.   I would first ensure I change my mindset and see the positives in my situation. There will be no distractions from a network and no other option but to be lean. Finally anything I achieve might be considered a miracle -  so let's go!  
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    If you could go back in time, and ask yourself one question, what would it be?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I would not ask myself a question. I'd let my younger self know its all possible and definitely easier than I thought.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="question">How do you record your ideas?</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>All my ideas go into an Evernote page on my phone via GTD - it's called Billion dollar ideas. :)</p></div>


<div class="question">If you had a clone to do everything you do now, what would you do with your time?</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Read and write more as well as start another company.  I would travel Africa and evangelise the tech startup revolution. 
</p></div>

<div class="question">Bonus question: Any ideas you'll never do, but wish someone did?</div>

<div class="answer">
<p>Nope! Everything is on the cards someday. There are a few I probably couldn’t do, like disrupt TV as we know it. In my world, there would be no channels. You simply put in interests and passions in your phone and the connected TV finds the content for you.
