<div class="intro">John V Willshire is the founder of <a href="http://smithery.co/">Smithery</a>, an innovation studio. He’s known for ideas like “Making Things People Want > Making People Want Things”, and making <a href="http://artefactshop.com/">Artefact Cards</a>. He is currently at large..</div>

<div class="question">
  If you had no money, fame, connections or any of your current resources -- just your knowledge and your brain -- how would you start?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I’d go and find some people to have coffee with. There’s been an interesting, useful trend over the last fifteen years for people to use the internet to just get a few like-minded folk together in a place, people who were never able to ‘see’ each other before. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Just sitting and chatting through problems that people have, and reacting with instant ideas, has always been a strength of mine, I guess. I work better that way - rather than come up with something from scratch, having someone else act as a catalytic source is vital. Mind you, if I’ve know money, I’d have to blag a coffee off someone until the next meeting...

<div class="question">If you could go back in time, and ask yourself one question, what would it be?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    That subject at school is called 'Art & Design’ - why not ignore the first bit, and concentrate on the second…?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">How do you record your ideas?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I use <a href="http://artefactshop.com/">Artefact Cards</a>, and not just because I came up with them. They’re small blank playing cards that you use with a Sharpie.

    So you have to write a precise articulation of an idea onto something permanent, and then you can cycle it back into whatever you’re thinking of. For instance, I made a card with “Time Is Not The Same As Progress” a while back, but have cycled it into a talk I’m writing, which is a collection of idea on cards at the moment - it helps find the flow between ideas.

<div class="question">If you had a clone to do everything you do now, what would you do with your time?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I’d go people watching more. Hang out in places, seeing how people do things, talk to each other, spots things that need fixing. I do it when I can now, but it’s one of those things that gets quickly shoved to the bottom of a pile when things need doing. I’d also write a book, a collection of wee thinking tools and approaches I’ve found quickly useful in solving problems. I’d like to do it now, but haven’t found the excuse of time.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">Bonus question: Any ideas you'll never do, but wish someone did?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Well, never say never. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You never know what a future client base is going to look like (this last year has been particularly varied, financial data companies to business electronics manufacturers to Universities). 
  </p>
  <p>
    I’d quite like someone to come up with a way to provide much, much better careers advice systems for schools - in the UK in particular, I think we waste so much talent by forcing children through the exam system we do, so that they’re picking subjects based on the school’s needs rather than their own. But if they don’t understand what they might want to do, or even know that it exists, how are they meant to say otherwise?
