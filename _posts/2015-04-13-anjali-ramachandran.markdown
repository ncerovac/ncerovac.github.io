<div class="intro">
  Anjali Ramachandran is a technology marketer. She's known for being head of innovation at PHD, co-founder of <a href="http://adaslist.co/">Ada’s List</a> and writer of the <a href="http://tinyletter.com/anjali28/">Other Valleys newsletter</a>  and is currently co-authoring a short e-book on how technology is disrupting the developing world.

<div class="question">
    If you had no money, fame, connections or any of your current resources — just your knowledge and your brain — how would you start?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    There is no shortage today of free online courses now to work on existing skills or learn new ones. I’d go to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/">Skillshare</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> or <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> to pick a module I’m interested in and improve my skills. I could even start teaching on Udemy or Skillshare, initially for free and then when I have a portfolio of content, I could start monetising my work. I’m not a designer or developer, but I know my way around strategy and marketing, so I’d sign up to the global virtual workforce of companies like <a href="http://www.victorsandspoils.com/#/community">Victors &amp; Spoils</a> or the <a href="http://www.nobl.io/">Nobl Collective </a>and work with them on consultancy briefs where relevant (these are paid opportunities). Sites like <a href="http://thebackscratchers.com/">The Backscratchers</a> actually go out and find paid work for freelancers, so I’d sign up to those too. <br />
  </p>

  <p>
    If I was starting from scratch, I’d also do what I did back when I really started out - create a blog to showcase my thinking, interests and professional activities, whether that is teaching an online course, attending or organising a conference or commenting on content I find interesting. I think it’s pretty important to give people who would want to hire you a sense of who you are and what you do this way. <br />
  </p>

  <p>
    Finding a community of people who can help you get to your next project, give you advice when you need it and generally support you is also important. If you’re a woman in tech, something like <a href="http://adaslist.co/">Ada’s List</a>, for example. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    If you could go back in time, and ask yourself one question, what would it be?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Why do you want to waste time over-thinking things? Just getting on with it will help you figure out if it’s something you’re really passionate about or not, and bingo - you’ll lose the self-doubt.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="question">How do you record your ideas?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Google Docs, it’s the easiest solution I’ve found. I also use <a href="http://artefactshop.com/">Artefact Cards</a> when I’m trying to plan out a presentation or project on a table. Small Moleskines do the trick when random ideas come to me if I’m listening to someone speak.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    If you had a clone to do everything you do now, what would you do with your time?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Definitely more reading and writing. I’d also try and get a part-time fellowship or research role somewhere to explore ideas related to making money from innovative business models, the future of media in a distracted world and/or making governments in developing countries more citizen-friendly digitally. And I’d like to spend more time volunteering at the <a href="http://www.ministryofstories.org/">Ministry of Stories</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Any ideas you’ll never do, but wish someone did?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    A service that collects used electrical items from your doorstep on demand during a pre-booked one-hour time slot, wipes your data for you, and recycles, upcycles or sustainably disposes of them. Where are all  those used mobile phones, tablets and laptops going every few years?! That problem is only going to get worse.
  </p>
  <p>
    An <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> for all connected devices so owners can start getting more out of the multiple personal and home devices they will use in the future. <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3041104/app-economy/samsungs-100-million-internet-of-things-bet-is-even-crazier-than-you-think">Samsung is investing $100 million in it</a> so I’d like to see how that pans out. <br />
  </p>

</div>
<div class="question">
  Bonus question: What should we have asked you?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>How about what I’d do if I came into a million dollars?!</p>
