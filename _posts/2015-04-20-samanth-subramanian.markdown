shortDesc: Correspondent for the The National

<div class="intro">
    Samanth Subramanian is the India correspondent for the The National. He’s known for his essays and narrative journalism, which have appeared in publications such as the New York Times, the New Yorker, the Guardian and Caravan, and is currently recovering from the work involved in producing his second book, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/09/this-divided-island-stories-from-sri-lankan-war-review-moving-portrayal-samanth-subramanian">“This Divided Island: Stories from the Sri Lankan War.”</a>

<div class="question">
    If you had no money, fame, connections or any of your current resources — just your knowledge and your brain — how would you start?
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>
        Well, I have no money or fame now, so this isn’t entirely a
        hypothetical question! I’d start the way I started the first time
        around — by reading widely, by trying to think seriously about what I
        read, and by indulging my curiosity about the world around me. People
        don’t always make time for their inherent curiosity, I find; for a
        journalist, that’s inexcusable. Curiosity impels you to go out and
        talk to people, to find out why things are the way they are, to probe
        deeply. Good writing is born out of good reading.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I’m able to do both these things consistently — discover new information, and write
        clearly about it — I think I’d survive. As every magazine editor will
        tell you, the world of journalism will always welcome the additional
        person who can do these things well.

<div class="question">
    If you could go back in time, and ask yourself one question, what would it be?
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>Why aren’t you taking more risks?</p>
</div>

<div class="question">How do you record your ideas?</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>Either the <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/en/">Moleskine</a> that’s always in my bag or the native Notes app
    on my iPhone.</p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    If you had a clone to do everything you do now, what would you do with your time?
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>
        More travel. More reading. More swimming. I’d live elsewhere too — a
        different city every year or two. Go back to university a number of
        times. I’d have a far better life than my clone, clearly.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="question">
    Any ideas you’ll never do, but wish someone did?
</div>

<div class="answer">
    <p>
        Archiving the world’s dying languages in some way. A language uniquely
        encodes ideas and cultural ways of thinking (at least according to one
        theory), and letting these languages die feels like letting a part of
        humanity die. There must be a way we can build the language equivalent
        of the Svalbard seed vault — a global repository not only of scripts
        and sounds but also of the ideas held within different languages. That
        would be a glorious project.
