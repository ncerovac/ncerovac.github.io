<div class="intro">Nemanja Cerovac is a young entrepreneur. He's known for <a href="http://fishingbooker.com">FishingBooker</a> and is currently working on <a href="http://LaptopFriendly.in">LaptopFriendly</a>.</div>


<div class="question">
  If you had no money, fame, connections or any of your current resources -- just your knowledge and your brain -- how would you start?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Since I know how to code, I would signup on freelance websites to try to find a gig. At the same time, I'd look for a job serving in a cafe or bar. If not, probably any job that will help me to just get money to survive.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would start few niche topics using Google Trends, and build websites that I can fill with content such as images, videos; things that can raise discussions and promote sharing using content that can be collected automatically. I'd optimise for search engine rankings. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Once that is up I would spend some time trying to build community around that with social media and subscriptions. Then add ads to create an automated income. 
  </p>
  <p>That would be a start :)</p>

</div>

 

<div class="question">If you could go back in time, and ask yourself one question, what would it be?</div>

 

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Why don't you try to spend some more time testing different ideas on internet?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">How do you record your ideas?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I love voice recording since I can express the emotions when I have that <em>aha</em> moment. Later on, when I listen it again, I can focus on <em>why</em> I got so hyped about it in a first place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes I write ideas down. I  use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> on my laptop.
  </p>
  <p>
  But I put most of ideas in <a href="https://keep.google.com/">Google Keep</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most important thing is the reminder! Once a week it reminds me to analyse ideas and to categorize them by how quick I can test it out and how big it is. So then I put them in Kick-Ass-Ideas google docs and start making them.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">If you had a clone to do everything you do now, what would you do with your time?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    I would focus more on helping young people with no technical knowledge to make things online, especially on places that are underdeveloped. With their creative minds and vast possibilities of internet, totally different virtual world would be built.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also I would organize a lot of hip-hop dancing competitions and camps for people to connect and dance from all over the world.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="question">Bonus question: Any ideas you'll never do, but wish someone did?</div>

<div class="answer">
  <p>
    hm... there are few services that are trying to substitute business card with virtual one. So I had the idea to make one app that everybody would use for business card and just stop printing them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The other one was more like dream about phone that you can make like LEGO. I'm glad that Google's <a href="http://www.projectara.com/">Project Ara</a> is now in prototype mode.
